          <h3>About our Knives</h3>
          <p>Knives are only as capable as the materials they are made from. This pertains to the handle and beyond, of course, but is even more so critical when you're speaking of the blade. There are varying degrees of complexity in each blade, completely dependant upon the alloys used in the billet, any special pattern welds/san-mai requests, the actual design of the blade itself, the method in which is was processed (stock removal vs hot forge), and so on for an almost never-ending list of variables. This complexity can quickly intensify in any direction depending on the smith's current posession of a hydraulic press/power hammer, and skillset--regardless of the tool used.</p>
          <p>As the video below touches on, blademaking is a conglomeration of skills that are all over the place, taking various bits and pieces as needed depending on what is being utilized for a particular piece. We craft knives with materials and techniques that ensure the unit stays intact and operable for as long as physically possible, so that it's ready to go when needed most.</p>

          <h3>The Making Process</h3>
          <iframe id="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXwz47doj8c?si=Q59hC2RZWGzgQ6HI" title="Why Custom Knives are Expensive" frameborder="0"  allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
          <p>As you can see, there is a lot going on here. The material for the blade (again, depending on complexity and what the client is after) is chosen prior, and is drafted into a billet. The billet can be then forged into shape. If the client has a specific pattern weld/build, the billet may undergo a <strong><em>stock removal </em></strong>process to outline the two-dimensional shape of the blade.</p>
          <p>Once the blade has reached this point, the bevel of the blade can be created. This can be achieved through a manual process, using files or other hand tools, or a belt grinder (which is more heavily preferred, though significantly more expensive).</p>
          <p>As the bevel edge to the blade gets around the thickness of a dime (again, depending on the blade's needs), we will then begin to do some prep--remove any deep scratches/nicks/gouges/pits/whatever while the steel is still annealed (<em>softened</em>) and ensure everything is up to par. Now for the fun part--heat treating!</p>
          <p>The blade undergoes a process known as <em>heat-treating</em> and then <em>tempering</em> to accomplish a few things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>heat-treat: </strong>This is done with the intent of forcing the steel to undergo a restructuring at the microscopic level, by (typically) heating the steel to its non-ferrous (<em>non-magnetic</em>) point, and then rapidly submerging the steel in a liquid (some examples are Parks 50 quench oil, saline water brine, and canola oil). This makes the steel <em>extremely</em> hard, but also to our dismay, <em>extremely brittle</em>. This is solved in the next step, <em>tempering</em>.</li>
              <li><strong>temper: </strong>This is done after the quench, (like, immediately) with the intent of softening the steel ever so slightly with the goal of increasing the resilience of the blade itself, while not so much that we lose our ability to retain an edge. For both steps, the times, temperatures, and even procedures may change depending on the material being worked with and the end result in mind for the client.</li>
              <li>After these steps are completed, and the blade undergoes several other steps to get it fit and ready for handle material, as well as getting an edge on and ensuring the finished knife is ready for tasking.</li>
            </ul>
              <p>Overall, again, with these factors in play, a knife can be made in a few hours, or several months, depending on the complexity of the build. With the know-how behind the processes, and premium materials sourced right here in the USA (with exceptions for exotic woods, for example), you're really only limited by your budget and your imagination. That being said, you don't have to empty an account to buy a great knife! We attempt to keep a collection of knives in stock that strike a balance between performance and price, however they tend so sell fast, so if nothing is available, feel free to subscribe to email notifications so you have a chance next time!</p>

              <p>Same choice of configurations as prior, however the blade material is a pattern-welded steel billet comprised of multiple steel layers that tend to play nice with each other, such as 1095, 1084, and 15n20. The layers of metal are heated and manipulated under force in a specific process until they are one billet. The billet can then be cut and stacked in varying fashions with multiple techniques to achieve a target pattern or look. These blades are a labor-intensive process, and have exponentially more variables to consider in the process, including the heat-treat and temper. Prices are of course a reflection of this. </p>
              <p>The variations available are the ladder pattern, raindrop, random, feather, mosaic, fireball, and sharkstooth.</p>

              <p>Following the same processes as prior, these blades are even more advanced in construction. These techniques incorporate precious metals such as gold and silver, as well as constrasting metals--such as copper and titanium into the billet, to create intense artistic effects with dramatic colors and contrast. The variables in this billet type are even stricter than those before, as the metals involved require more finnese to get them to fully cooperate, even in ideal situations. These billets take an absolute mastery of the forge, and are of course priced accordingly. </p>
